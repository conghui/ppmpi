1. `MPI_Send` and `MPI_Recv` are blocking function

2. If `MPI_Recv` tries to receive something from the source which is not
   send the message, then `MPI_Recv` will block at the statement.

3. If the buffer in `MPI_Recv` is not large enough to hold the total amount
   of message or the *count* argument in `MPI_Recv` is less than the total
   length of the message, the program will crash, indicating that

      Message truncated, error stack

4. If we use *MPI_ANY_SOURCES* wildcards in `MPI_Recv` and the total number
   of call to `MPI_Recv` is greater than the total number of `MPI_Send`,
   the program will hang up.

5. If the tag in `MPI_Recv` and `MPI_Send` are not equal, the program will
   hang up.

6. If the communicator in `MPI_Recv` and `MPI_Send` are not equal, the
   program will hang up too.

7. The *MPI_Datatype* in `MPI_Send` is *MPI_CHAR*, however, the
   *MPI_Datatype* in `MPI_Recv` is *MPI_INT* instead of *MPI_CHAR*, the
   program runs normally in my box. However, such kind of behavious maybe
   undefined. When I call `MPI_Get_count` with *MPI_INT* as the data type,
   the returned value is a nagative one. But when I substitue *MPI_INT*
   with *MPI_CHAR*, the returned value is equal to the number of elements
   that is sent from `MPI_Send`.
