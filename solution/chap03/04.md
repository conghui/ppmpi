1. If process *p* send message to process *p-1*, then the first process 
   whose id is *0* will send message to process *-1*, which is an invalid 
   process id. And the last process, whose id is *n-1* will not receive any
   message that sent to it. so the last process will block the program.

2. To send the messages in a cycle way, the first process should send its 
   message to the last message. It is shown in program 04.cxx
