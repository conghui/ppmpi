1. We can compile the MPI program as normal C/C++ program by just 
   substituing gcc/g++ by mpicc/mpic++. In fact, `mpicc` is just a wrapper 
   of `gcc` with some extra arguments to `gcc`. You can find out the extra 
   arguments with the `mpicc -show`. In my computer, the output is 

    gcc -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions -Wl,-z,relro -I/usr/include/mpich2 -L/usr/lib -lmpich -lopa -lmpl -lrt -lcr -lpthread

2. If the greeting program runs with only one process, there are only one 
   process in the whole program. The process ID of the only one process is 
   0, which is the receiver process. However, no process will send the 
   message to the receiver, so the program will output nothing.

3. In my Linux box, I can run the greeting program with less than 153 
   processes. If the # of processes exceed 153 (including), the program 
   will raise a segment fault. But, what is that?
